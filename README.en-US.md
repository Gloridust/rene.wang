This is the source code for my blog and also a powerful static blogging site.

-   [x] Supports custom theme development
-   [x] Syncs articles from Notion
-   [x] Multi-language UI and articles
-   [ ] Comments

## üéûÔ∏è Usage

Click on the Use this template button on the top right corner of the page to create your own repository.

Afterwards, modify the configuration file located at ./site.config.js.

-   title: Blog name
-   root: Blog root URL
-   author: Author information
    -   name: Name
    -   intro: Introduction

If you need to use Notion for writing, create a new Integration in Notion to obtain an API Key. Also, get your database_id.

Then, add two environment variables in the Github repository:

```bash
NOTION_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=<YOUR_ID>
```

Once everything is ready, you can choose the deployment method you prefer.

## ‚úç Writing

Currently, two writing methods are supported:

Place the Markdown file in the /posts/<categories> directory. Currently, up to two-level directories are supported.
Automatically sync articles from Notion.
If you choose the first method, each article must have at least the following two frontmatter:

-   title
-   date

If you choose to use Notion for writing, refer to this [database] () to create a similar one.

```

Add the server's git public key under Deploy Keys in the Github repository (generation method).
